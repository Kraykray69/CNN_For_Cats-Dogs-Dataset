The CNN for Cats and Dogs Dataset project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. Using the popular Cats and Dogs dataset, the CNN learns to distinguish between the two animal categories by analyzing patterns and features in the images. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image recognition tasks and serves as a foundational example of how CNNs can be applied to binary classification problems in computer vision.
